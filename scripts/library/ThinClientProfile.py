# Profile module to expose the wsadmin "objects", set the WebSphereVersion
# and update sys.path with the directories where Jython modules are found 
# specified by using the wsadmin.jython.libraries Java option.
#
# This profile module is primarily intended for use with the thinClient
# script that runs in an independent setup of a wsadmin thin client that
# is using a more recent version of Jython than that which comes with WAS.
# 
# The Java class that implements the wsadmin shell updates sys.path but also 
# automatically preloads Jython modules found in directory trees specified by 
# wsadmin.script.libraries.  This causes import problems for Jython libraries 
# with module interdependencies as well as dependencies on the WAS Admin objects.  
# The ThinClientProfile.py only modifies sys.path and does not preload any Jython 
# modules it finds in the libraries specified with wsadmin.jython.libraries.  
# The ThinClientProfile will load multiple libraries if there are multiple paths 
# specified with wsadmin.jython.libraries separated by a semi-colon.  Any scripts 
# that run must have a proper import statement to load desired modules from the 
# libraries. 
#
# NOTE: This profile is intended for use when the standard script libraries
# that come with WAS v7.0, v8.0, v8.5 are not used. You need to rename the 
# directory where the libraries are located to avoid having them loaded by 
# the wsadmin shell. They are located in:
#      <WAS_INSTALL_ROOT>/scriptLibraries
#
# This profile may be used when a more recent version of Jython is used.  
# You can download a more recent Jython and extract the archive into a directory 
# in <WAS_INSTALL_ROOT>/optionalLibraries.  Move the existing jython directory to 
# something like jython-v2.1.  Extract the newer Jython into a directory such as 
# jython-v2.5.2.  Make a symlink with the name jython to the newer version.  
# (The command is: ln -s jython-v2.5.2 jython )  To change back to using the 
# Jython that comes with WAS, remove the jython symlink and recreate it pointing 
# to the older jython directory. (ln -s jython-v2.1 jython) 
# 
# If you want to use a newer version of Jython as well as the WAS script 
# libraries you can include the WAS script libraries in the 
# -Dwsadmin.jython.libraries option.  You also have to add import statements 
# for the Admin objects to each Admin module in the WAS script libraries.  
# There is a shell script named addAdminObjectImport.sh that can be used to 
# modify the Admin modules appropriately. Obviously, you should make a copy
# of the WAS scriptLibraries directory tree and move it to some other location
# before modifying the individual modules to include import statements for
# the Admin objects. 
#
# This approach to setting up sys.modules with the wsadmin objects comes
# from the Gibson, McGrath, Bergman book: WebSphere Application Server
# Administration using Jython.
